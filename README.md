# EmployeeTracker

The Employee Tracker application allows employers to view a list of employees at the company, their departments,roles, managers, and salary.
This allows employers to easily view and interact with data of the employees. 
In order to start the application, employers would use npm start from the command and a prompt of questions would be listed to show different aspects of the database.
